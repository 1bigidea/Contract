# CSS Wizardry Ltd. contract

This is the standard contract to which I—acting as CSS Wizardry Ltd.—operate.
This contract can be amended and updated to be tailored to individual clients
and projects, this is merely my boilerplate.

## Using this contract

In keeping with my sharing and open-source nature, I am making this contract
freely available for you to modify and use for yourself on your client projects.
I do, however, accept absolutely **zero liability for anything at all**. Use
entirely at your own risk.
